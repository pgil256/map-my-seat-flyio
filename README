**B. PURPOSE**

Map-my-seat aims to provide an innovative solution for K-12 teachers looking for an automated approach to creating seating charts. By inputting student details and classroom preferences, educators can efficiently devise their ideal seating arrangements.

**C. FEATURES**

The app focuses heavily on form rendering, with a meticulous organization to ensure user-friendliness:
* **Periods & Students Routes**: Dedicated to CRUD operations, allowing seamless integration of information.
* **Classrooms & Seating Charts**: Featuring dynamic tables that synthesize data from the 'periods' and 'students' routes. These routes enable users to visualize and save seating charts based on classroom design and student seating preferences.
* **Data Management**: Users exclusively populate the app's data, apart from SQL incremental identification. While the design follows RESTful principles‚Äîwith admin users accessing non-admin data‚Äîit's adaptable enough for local use, offering full feature access.

```
npm test
```

**F. API**

The embedded API is a straightforward node.js application (accessible in the "backend" directory).

**G. TECHNOLOGY**

Built on the robust framework of React 18.2.0 and Node 20.2.0, this app is a product of VITE. With Chakra UI modules managing the aesthetic appeal, the design is as intuitive as it's visually pleasing. 

To kickstart the backend:
1. Activate the PostgreSQL server (`sudo service postgresql start` for Linux users) on port 5432.
2. Initiate the node backend with `npm start`.
3. Launch the React frontend using `npm start`.

**H. VISION**

The driving force behind Map-my-seat is the passion to enhance educators' productivity. Crafting a seating chart, often viewed as mundane, can drain valuable time. In an era steered by technology, a solution that streamlines this process was long overdue. And Map-my-seat hopes to fill that void.

**I. ADDITIONAL NOTES**

* **Dockerfile**: For users interested in containers, the project is equipped with a Dockerfile that manages installations for both the Vite/React frontend and the Node.js backend.
* **Database Configuration**: The `fly.toml` file facilitates exporting the PostgreSQL database to a Knex database through fly.io, ensuring seamless data management.
